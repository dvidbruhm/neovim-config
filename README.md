My neovim config for python and markdown dev. For the python autocomplete to work, the installation of the neovim, jedi and flake8 packages are necessary:

```
pip install neovim jedi flake8
```

If using python envs, make sure the env is activated before launching neovim so it can find all packages in the env.
